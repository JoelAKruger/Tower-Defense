Tower aiming
When placing turret, automatically aim at nearest enemy tower


Win Condition: Own the whole upgraded world. There are two levels of tower tile.
You will have to choose between upgrading or defending. Both will cost you. What could be the consequence of not defending a tile?
UPGRADED TILES EARN YOU MORE RESOURCES
so like 1 resource / non-upgraded tile; 2 or 3 resources / upgraded tile

You can build defences (a fence), remove bridges, stuff like that

Each region: upgrade defences (fence), attack (taller sniper tower), or farm
Build / destroy bridges?
